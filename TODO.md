- create planet vars as sliders ideas: {    self.distance_from_sun = 1, self.temperature = 1, self.surface_pressure = 1,  self.sea_level = 0, self.texture = 1, self.mass = 1 ,self.size = 100}
- use pynoise to generate terrain texture see [this](https://pynoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial3.html#creating-the-terrain-height-map)
- change colour depending on plant varibles
- finish setting up [WindowPanel](https://www.ursinaengine.org/api_reference.html#WindowPanel)
- update model from sliders in window panel
- allow importing planet data from json files
- create animal clases and place on planet - they work on probility which comes from comparing planet varibles to that of ideal condtions for the animal then creating one with those condtions. 
- on animal click show widow panel of it's addaptions
